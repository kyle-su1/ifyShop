Critique Output: {'fake_review_likelihood': "Medium. While there's a TikTok trend, which isn't inherently fake, the reviews are generally very vague. The 'Yellow Robot Marketing' company on Goodfirms and Clutch has no reviews, and both sites prompt users to write one, suggesting a lack of organic feedback. The Reddit commentary ranges from negative ('yellow robot is a mistake') to general price comparisons. The TikTok reviews are unverifiable.", 'price_integrity': "Markup. The pricing for 'yellow robots' is extremely variable, ranging from under $10 CAD to tens of thousands. This suggests that 'yellow robot' is a very broad search term encompassing many different products. Without knowing the specific product, it's impossible to tell if any particular listing is a good deal or a markup, but the sheer range raises red flags. Some vendors like Ubuy have prices that are wildly higher than others, signaling potential overpricing.", 'hidden_flaws': ["The term 'yellow robot' is too broad, leading to a wide variety of products in search results. This makes direct price comparison difficult.", 'Many of the products listed are from marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, and AliExpress, which are known to have quality control issues and potential for scams.', 'Shipping costs are not consistently provided, making it difficult to determine the final price.', 'Refurbished Litter Robots have a history of error codes, according to a Reddit thread, which can lead to them being discarded by owners.', 'The yellow APS battery for Roomba is overpriced on some sites, even more than the iRobot website itself.']}

Critique Output: {'fake_review_likelihood': 'Medium. While there\'s no blatant coordinated fake review campaign evident, there are several points raising suspicion. First, the top reviews focus heavily on Logitech products, particularly the MX Keys S. This could indicate a genuine preference, but also a possible marketing push. Second, the "Best of 2025" articles seem premature and could be based on sponsored content rather than rigorous testing.

Critique Output: {'fake_review_likelihood': "Medium. The ROLI review sounds suspiciously enthusiastic and vague ('next level!', 'so many uses!!!').  It lacks specifics and reads like marketing copy. There's also a single positive review mixed in with more technical discussions on Reddit, which is unusual. Some reviews also seem outdated (mentions of 'Black Friday 2025' and 'space heaters in 2026').", 'price_integrity': "Mixed. There's a HUGE range in keyboard prices (from $8 CAD to $25,413.97 CAD!), indicating a variety of models being scraped.  It's impossible to say if any specific keyboard is a 'good deal' without knowing the exact model. Some prices seem suspiciously high (over $25,000 for a 'keyboard' from Made-in-China.com? Likely a data error or a very specialized industrial keyboard). The mention of the Wooting 80HE costing $800+ after exchange, tax, and customs highlights the hidden costs of importing.", 'hidden_flaws': ['Logitech MK850 Performance is getting harder to track down (potential availability issues).', "One review states 'Even though most of Logitech's keyboard/mouse combo sets we tried were good, this keyboard was the only out-and-out disappointment' (unspecified Logitech keyboard is a lemon).", "The 'Best Keyboards in Canada' article from shoppingtrends.ca ALSO has 'Our Guide To The Best Space Heaters In Canada In 2026' (raises questions about the site's focus and potentially the quality of the reviews).", 'The high price of some mechanical keyboards may not be worth it to some users.', 'Importing keyboards from other countries can significantly increase the price due to exchange rates, taxes, and customs fees.']}
